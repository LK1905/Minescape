# Intro
The attack skill is one of the 3 main combat skills intended in the Minescape skill system, along with ranged and magic.
As with most skills in the minescape system, there are two main ways the attack skill will augment the normal minecraft
combat experience: rewards and restrictions.

The possibility of using both an attack and strength skill, similar to Runescape, 
has been discussed but has been decided against at this point. 
Switching this decision later should not require a large effort. 

# Rewards
## Overview
- Scaling attack damage regardless of weapon used. 
    Skill Mastery allows you to one shot passive mobs such as cows and chickens without a weapon.
    Formula for this defined as follows: base damage + (base damage * (currentLevel / maxLevel))
- Scaling percentage based health damage, up to 10% of mobs current health as bonus damage at max level.
- Increases to attack speed as you level up.
- Potential of double loot from monsters and perhaps increases in rarer drops. 
    The gold sword may reap extra benefits from these effects to promote using it. 

# Restrictions
## Overview
- Similar to digging, restrictions on usable weapons will be implemented so that you can only use weapons that your level allows.
- Level 1-15: Wooden Sword
- Level 15-30: Stone Sword
- Level 30-60: Iron Sword
- Level 60-80: Gold Sword (May augment gold sword with critical strike and other bonuses to offset the durability downgrade)
- Level 80-99: Diamond Sword
- Support for tinkers weapons will likely be directly integrated with this mod to apply restrictions,
    as well as define some added benefits based on the weapon type to promote more diversity in weapon choice.
