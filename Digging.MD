# Intro
The digging skill is intended to supplement and augment the Minecraft digging experience by providing both
rewards and restrictions based on your level in the skill.

# Rewards
## Overview
- [Level-based scaling block breaking speed](#scaling-break-speed)
- [Extra Resource Rewards](#extra-resource-rewards) 
- [Utility](#utility)

### Scaling Break Speed
- Mastery allows breaking blocks at diamond harvest speed without a tool (diamond tools would break even faster).

### Extra Resource Rewards
- Harvesting with a shovel gives a percent chance for drops from a rare loot table 
   (wood 1%) (stone 5%) (iron 7.5%) (gold 30%) (diamond 15%)
- Experience Lamps from breaking blocks
- Extra chances of getting flint out of gravel (100% chance at 99, togglable option to disable this and get gravel again)
- Loot Tables to be determined elsewhere, but with a focus on configurability by users or other modders that interface with the mod.

### Utility
- Level 90(?) allows breaking a stack of falling blocks all at once (i.e gravel or sand).
