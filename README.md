# Extensible Skills System
Part of the Runecraft mod system is an extensible skills system which allows other mod makers to hook into a Skills interface to create their own custom skills and define the interactions that skill has with players. This system comes with a mechanism to display these skills to users as part of the inventory gui and individual skills have the ability to define rewards and benefits from leveling up these skills.
